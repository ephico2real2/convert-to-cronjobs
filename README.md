# convert-to-cronjobs

### **Summary of Research and Plan for Converting Helm Chart Deployment to CronJob**

#### **Background and Context**
The Jira story involves converting a Helm chart template for a Kubernetes `Deployment` to a `CronJob`. This change is necessary to enable periodic execution of workloads that were previously running continuously. Since this task involves Helm charts, the templates may include placeholders (`{{ .Values }}`), conditionals, and other templating logic, which adds complexity to the conversion process.

### **Advantages of Using `CronJob` Over `Deployment` for Long-Running Processes**

1. **Efficient Resource Utilization**:
   - **`CronJob`**: Runs tasks only at specified intervals, freeing up cluster resources when the job is not executing. This is ideal for processes that donâ€™t need to run continuously, like periodic data synchronization, backups, or cleanup tasks.
   - **`Deployment`**: Keeps resources like Pods and their replicas running at all times, even when not actively needed, leading to potential wastage.

2. **Simplified Scheduling**:
   - **`CronJob`**: Native support for scheduling jobs using a `schedule` field (in CRON format), eliminating the need for custom scheduling logic in the application.
   - **`Deployment`**: Requires additional tools like external schedulers or manual application-level logic to achieve similar functionality.

3. **Reduced Complexity**:
   - **`CronJob`**: Removes the need to manage long-running Pods for tasks that are inherently periodic. Pods are created dynamically and terminated after task completion.
   - **`Deployment`**: Maintains Pods continuously, even for tasks that only need to execute periodically, requiring manual intervention to stop and restart tasks.

4. **Built-in Retry and Failure Handling**:
   - **`CronJob`**: Automatically retries failed jobs according to the configured `.spec.backoffLimit`, ensuring reliability without additional setup.
   - **`Deployment`**: Relies on application-level retry mechanisms, increasing complexity for error handling.

5. **No Need for PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs)**:
   - **`CronJob`**: As Pods are transient and only exist during task execution, PDBs are unnecessary, simplifying the configuration.
   - **`Deployment`**: Requires careful management of PDBs to ensure availability during updates or disruptions.

6. **Cost Optimization**:
   - **`CronJob`**: By running only when required, CronJobs reduce compute costs, making them a cost-effective solution for periodic tasks.
   - **`Deployment`**: Continuously running Pods incur costs even when idle.

7. **Native Kubernetes Support**:
   - **`CronJob`**: Leverages native Kubernetes functionality for task scheduling and execution, requiring no additional components or external schedulers.
   - **`Deployment`**: Needs extensions or manual scripting to achieve similar periodic execution behavior.

### **Research Summary**

1. **Understanding the Difference**:
   - **Deployment**: Manages long-running applications with replica management, rolling updates, and optional PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs).
   - **CronJob**: Schedules tasks to run periodically or at specific times, eliminating the need for continuous replication or PDBs.

2. **Challenges Identified**:
   - **Converting Deployment-Specific Fields**:  
     - Removing fields like `replicas`, `strategy`, and PDBs, which are not relevant to CronJobs.
   - **Restructuring YAML**:  
     - Transforming `spec.template` to align with the `jobTemplate.spec` structure required by CronJobs.
   - **Helm Templating Compatibility**:  
     - Ensuring the Helm chart structure remains intact, including placeholders and conditionals.
   - **Adding Schedule Field**:  
     - Incorporating a `schedule` field dynamically into the Helm template (e.g., `{{ .Values.cron.schedule }}`) for periodic job execution.

3. **Options for Implementation**:
   - **Manual Conversion**:
     - Directly editing YAML files for small-scale use cases or one-off requirements.
   - **Automation Using Scripts**:
     - **Shell Script**:  
       - Use `sed` for quick transformations of rendered YAML files, suitable for simple, flat structures.
     - **Python Script**:  
       - Use `pyyaml` to handle complex, deeply nested YAML and enable future scalability for templated Helm charts.

### **Plan to Address the Jira Story**

1. **Proposed Approach**:
   - Focus on automating the conversion process with a **Python script** for structured parsing and transformation of YAML files.
     - Replace `kind: Deployment` with `kind: CronJob`.
     - Restructure `spec.template` into `jobTemplate.spec`.
     - Add a `schedule` field using Helm templating placeholders (e.g., `{{ .Values.cron.schedule }}`).
     - Remove unsupported fields like `replicas`, `strategy`, and PDB references.
   - Maintain Helm templating logic in the converted YAML, ensuring compatibility with `.Values` placeholders and other Helm constructs.

2. **Validation Process**:
   - Use Helm tools to validate the updated chart:
     - `helm lint` to check the chart structure for errors.
     - `helm template` to render the templates with specific `values.yaml` files for verification.
   - Validate the rendered CronJob YAML with Kubernetes dry-run:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f rendered-cronjob.yaml
     ```
   - Deploy the converted CronJob in a sandbox environment to test periodic execution.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document the conversion process, including how to use the Python script and adapt Helm templates for CronJob-specific configurations.
   - Provide clear examples of modifying `values.yaml` to specify schedules and other CronJob parameters.

4. **Future Scalability**:
   - Ensure the solution supports multiple environments (`staging`, `production`) by parameterizing environment-specific fields in `values.yaml`.

### **Progress Update**
- Research completed on the structural differences between `Deployment` and `CronJob`.
- Challenges and considerations for Helm templating compatibility have been identified.
- Validation tools and steps (e.g., `helm lint`, `kubectl dry-run`) have been outlined.
- A clear plan has been defined to handle conversion, validation, and documentation.
